sklearn style


Harness:

- init(graph)

- fit(source, hyperparams, n_iter, print_freq, etc)
    interface directly with the graph; need to write different harnesses per
        problem



Graph

- init(canvas, edges, outputs, contraints, updates)

- compile()
    build internal theano function

- call(**kwargs)
    must match the compiled function
    buffer inputs if too large?
    after every call, execute constraints
